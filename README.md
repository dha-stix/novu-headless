## Getting Started
- Clone the repository
  
- Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`

- Create an `env.local` file containing your Novu credentials
  ```txt
  NOVU_API_KEY=
  NEXT_PUBLIC_NOVU_APP_ID=
  ```
- Create a simple Novu workflow that sends in-app notifications to users and update the `api/notify.ts` file with the changes.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server and interact with the application.
